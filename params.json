{"body":"ScribbishWP Theme\r\n=================\r\n\r\n[Packagethief][QP] (aka Jeffrey Allan Hardy) has created an awesome theme for\r\n[Typo][] called [Scribbish][].  As a WordPress user, I was extremely jealous\r\nbecause I have been unable to find a theme that comes anywhere close to the\r\nsame simplicity and elegance.  So with Jeff's permission, I created a WordPress\r\nversion of the Scribbish theme which I've dubbed ScribbishWP.\r\n\r\nScribbishWP attempts to format posts according to the [hAtom microformat specification][hAtom].\r\nNote that all of your post content must be valid XHTML to produce hAtom-compliant\r\noutput.\r\n\r\nScribbishWP has only been tested on WordPress 2.2.  Your mileage may vary on\r\nother versions.  I've also only tested it with the blog options that I use so\r\nthere may be some areas that will not display properly with other options.\r\nIn particular, the popup comment entry window has not been themed yet.\r\n\r\nThere are several style variations available in ScribbishWP:\r\n\r\n* Original-width or wide-width layout\r\n* Scribbish 2.0 or Scribbish 3.0 header styles\r\n* Right or left sidebar position\r\n\r\nThe defaults are original-width layout, right sidebar, and Scribbish 2.0 header\r\nstyles because that is what I use on this blog.  You can change the defaults by\r\nediting the `style.css` file.  Just look for the commented sections.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nJust unpack the archive into your WordPress `wp-content/themes` directory.  You\r\ncan then use the WordPress Administration interface to activate the ScribbishWP\r\ntheme.\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\n--------\r\n\r\nScribbishWP is a work in progress.  If you discover any bugs, display problems,\r\nor browser compatibility issues, please let me know.  You can reach me at\r\nkenny [dot] pitt [at] gmail [dot] com.\r\n\r\nVersion History\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nScribbishWP uses a two-part version number in the form `x.x-y.y`.  The `x.x`\r\npart represents the version of ScribbishWP itself, and the `y.y` part\r\nrepresents the version of the original Scribbish theme on which it is based.\r\n\r\n#### v1.0-3.0\r\n\r\n* Support for WordPress 2.x configurable sidebar widgets.  A new \"Syndication\"\r\n  widget and a modified version of the \"Meta\" widget are included to allow you\r\n  to configure your sidebar to match the default ScribbishWP sidebar.\r\n* Improved [hAtom][] support based on [Scribbish 3.0][Scribbish30].\r\n* Support for displaying the comment count after the post title as seen on\r\n  [Quoted-Printable][QP].\r\n* Dropped support for WordPress 1.5.\r\n\r\n#### v0.1-2.0\r\n\r\n* Initial release based on [Scribbish 2.0][Scribbish20].\r\n\r\n[QP]:          http://quotedprintable.com/\r\n[Typo]:        http://typosphere.org/\r\n[hAtom]:       http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom\r\n[Scribbish]:   http://quotedprintable.com/pages/scribbish\r\n[Scribbish20]: http://quotedprintable.com/assets/2007/2/17/scribbish-2.0.tar.gz\r\n[Scribbish30]: http://quotedprintable.com/assets/2007/2/17/scribbish-3.0.tar.gz\r\n","google":"UA-36122413-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
