        <h1>ScribbishWP Theme</h1>

<p><a href="http://quotedprintable.com/">Packagethief</a> (aka Jeffrey Allan Hardy) has created an awesome theme for
<a href="http://typosphere.org/">Typo</a> called <a href="http://quotedprintable.com/pages/scribbish">Scribbish</a>.  As a WordPress user, I was extremely jealous
because I have been unable to find a theme that comes anywhere close to the
same simplicity and elegance.  So with Jeff's permission, I created a WordPress
version of the Scribbish theme which I've dubbed ScribbishWP.</p>

<p>ScribbishWP attempts to format posts according to the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom">hAtom microformat specification</a>.
Note that all of your post content must be valid XHTML to produce hAtom-compliant
output.</p>

<p>ScribbishWP has only been tested on WordPress 2.2.  Your mileage may vary on
other versions.  I've also only tested it with the blog options that I use so
there may be some areas that will not display properly with other options.
In particular, the popup comment entry window has not been themed yet.</p>

<p>There are several style variations available in ScribbishWP:</p>

<ul>
<li>Original-width or wide-width layout</li>
<li>Scribbish 2.0 or Scribbish 3.0 header styles</li>
<li>Right or left sidebar position</li>
</ul><p>The defaults are original-width layout, right sidebar, and Scribbish 2.0 header
styles because that is what I use on this blog.  You can change the defaults by
editing the <code>style.css</code> file.  Just look for the commented sections.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Just unpack the archive into your WordPress <code>wp-content/themes</code> directory.  You
can then use the WordPress Administration interface to activate the ScribbishWP
theme.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>ScribbishWP is a work in progress.  If you discover any bugs, display problems,
or browser compatibility issues, please let me know.  You can reach me at
kenny [dot] pitt [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>

<h2>Version History</h2>

<p>ScribbishWP uses a two-part version number in the form <code>x.x-y.y</code>.  The <code>x.x</code>
part represents the version of ScribbishWP itself, and the <code>y.y</code> part
represents the version of the original Scribbish theme on which it is based.</p>
